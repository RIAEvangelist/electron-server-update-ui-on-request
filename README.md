[Slack help request on #electron from atom-shell slack](https://atomio.slack.com/archives/C044E597S/p1500782470626367)

***from g10dras :***
I am looking for a  sample electron app which will act as a http server, receives text in http request and update the full screen Browser Window with that text.
I am using electron v1.6.10 and npm v5.3.0 on Rasbian Jessie.

***me :***
Here you go ;)
